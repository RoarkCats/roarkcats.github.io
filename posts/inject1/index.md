# Inject 1
This week Jeffrey has requested that I setup a modded Minecraft server accessible to the public for team building! He has added a twist, however, the server must be setup with Podman (an alt to Docker) and rootless at that!

I'm not sure how doable this is, but we'll give it a shot

- Requirement Steps
    - Setup Podman
    - Make Podman rootless
    - Setup modded Minecraft container
    - Test public connection

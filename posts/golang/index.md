### Setup
1. Downloaded & installed Go from [go.dev](https://go.dev)
2. Installed VSCode extension
    - [<img src="https://github.com/RoarkCats/roarkcats.github.io/blob/main/posts/golang/govscode.png" width=25%>](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go)
3. Created standard workspace folder path `../<user>/go/src/<projects>` for my modules
4. Created an example module `../example/` with a `main.go` file
    - Don't think the file *has* to be called 'main', but if it runs, there must be a file within the module that starts with `package main` on the first line (you also put that in `main.go` ofc)

### Guides & Docs
The docs for Go are good, but these helped me more personally

- [Learn Go in 12 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8LgvuEBraI)
- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/)
- [Go Packages](https://pkg.go.dev)

### Setup
1. Downloaded & installed Go from [go.dev](go.dev)
2. Installed VSCode extension
    - [[Go VSCode Extension](./govscode.png)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go)
3. Created standard workspace folder path `../<user>/go/src/<projects>` for my modules
4. Created an example module `../example/` with a `main.go` file
    - Don't think the file *has* tobe called "main", but if it runs, there must be a file within the module that starts with `package main` on the first line
